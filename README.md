> My kryptonian Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

install nuxt with axios 

setup axios 

get the first page with axios 

nuxt router +  dynamic pages 

pagination

mounted() hook is to late

there is no reactivity on the server 

on every request we create a new app and a new store!

we need to get the data from the graphql on the server side and not on the client

settimeouts will create huge memory leaks

NO SSR needed behind auth

Many JS plugins rely on the window object.

pagination is hard 

you will need fallback for directives

there is no window on the server
